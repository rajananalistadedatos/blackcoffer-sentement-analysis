What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
During the project execution, we faced the following challenges:

After data integration, the content of the file was not readable.
Mapping the values with the required columns.

How the Technical Challenges were Solved
To solve the technical challenges, we provided the following solutions as follow:

To get the content into the CSV format after integration we used the Io module to get the text content.
To get the mapping values we created the CSV file and store the record in it and fetch that record to the SQl.

Business Impact
Using this script the client can now fetch the Qualtrics data into the SQL server automatically after every 1 hour.
