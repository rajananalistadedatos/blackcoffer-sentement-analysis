Title: Streamlining Time Calculation in Warehouse Management: Leveraging ShipHero API and Google BigQuery Integration

Paragraph:

Client Background
Client: A leading retail firm in the USA
Industry Type: Retail
Products & Services: Retail Solutions, Supply Chain, Warehouse Management
Organization Size: 100+
The Problem

The problem was to efficiently calculate the time taken by each personnel on their shifts in a warehouse management system.
Data needed to be extracted from ShipHero API and processed to generate meaningful insights.
There was a need for a web interface to provide user-friendly access to the data and allow for data filtering.
There is a mapping issue in Python Script which occurred in December of 2022. Maybe due to the addition of another warehouse. This is an open issue and ShipHero is unable to provide any reliable solution for the same. [Issue has been highlighted below in the section of ‘’Known Issues’’]

Our Solution

Creating an API to Google BigQuery using a Python script deployed on Google Cloud.
The Python script automated data extraction from ShipHero API, transformation, and loading into Google BigQuery.
Google Data Studio was used to create a dashboard for reporting and visualization.

Solution Architecture

The solution involved two main components: a Python script and a web interface (Web App).
The Python script utilized ShipHero API to fetch data and calculate personnel shift times. It then stored the processed data in Google BigQuery.
The web interface allowed users to log in, apply filters to data tables fetched from BigQuery, and visualize the data.
Google Cloud services were used for hosting the Python script and deploying the web app.
