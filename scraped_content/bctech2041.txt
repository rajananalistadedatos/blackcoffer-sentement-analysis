The Problem
Create Jenkins shared library for the following:

Our Solution

We created a Jenkins shared library in which we are using AWS  ec2 describe-images command with the help of aws cli if an ami don’t exist than describe-images throws error
We created a Jenkins shared library in which we are using aws ec2 describe-network-acls  for validating we were comparing input name with VPC
We created a Jenkins shared library in which we are using aws ec2  describe-instances for validating we were checking input name with SecurityGroups group
