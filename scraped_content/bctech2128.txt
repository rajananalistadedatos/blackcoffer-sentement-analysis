Project Description
For building Business Dashboards in Wink Report , collect data from the following sources – 
ServiceM8XeroFacebookGoogle AdsCommuniqa
Explore/analyze the underlying data tables from each Data Source. Make useful reports using different tables from different data sources based on client’s requirement. Set up formulas in each report to calculate desired fields. Add a custom visualization to each report for making dashlets. Add dashlets to newly created dashboards. 
Our Solution
For collecting the data from the sources (ServiceM8 , Xero , Facebook , Google Ad) native connectors have been used , available in the Wink Report. It fetches the following data/tables from around the given data sources –

Data Pipeline : For collecting data from Communiqa website (https://www.communiqa.com.au/) , web scraping has been used as there is no connector available for Communiqa to Wink Report. By scraping Communiqa , we get the following data –
Account , Date , Total calls , Total unanswered calls , Total engaged calls , Total answered calls , Total minutes etc.
Then , we have merged different tables from different sources to get desired reports. Store all reports belonging to the same dashboard in a separate folder. Do this for all the dashboard , then setup formula for calculating desired fields. Add appropriate visualization to each report for each folder. Then , finally add all dashlets belonging to the same folder to a newly created dashboard.

What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
Merging reports from different data sources : Faced the issue of making the cross report from different data sources.Take live parameter input daily in Dashboards from User : Taking live user parameter input daily to feed in Wink report Dashboard. So that dashboard KPIs can change accordingly.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
Merging reports from different data sources : Resolved this issue by using merge report configuration. Using this we were able to join tables from different data sources like – Left join , Right join , Union etc.Take live parameter input daily in Dashboards from User : To resolve this issue , we added a custom field in reports with input tag. Users can enter their parameter in this custom field and all dashlets in the dashboard would update automatically.
