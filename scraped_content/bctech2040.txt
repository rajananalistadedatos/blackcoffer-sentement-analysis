Title: Design and develop PowerShell script

Paragraph:

Client Background
Client: A leading tech firm in the USA
Industry Type:  IT
Services: SaaS, Products
Organization Size: 100+
The Problem
Create a PowerShell script for the following:

check and enable auditing:- client wanted a PowerShell script that checks NTFS Rule is given to a folder or not and adds a rule to it
configuring winrm for remote windows server:- this client wanted a PowerShell script which helps us to connect to another windows remote server
check audit of windows/system32 folder and windows/inf folder of remote windows server:- this client wanted a PowerShell script which help us to connect to the remote server and check their  NTFS Rule for windows/system32 and windows/inf folder also we can add rule for those folders

Our Solution
check and enable auditing
for checking and enabling auditing of the file we used  PowerShell NTFSSecurity module

for checking the audit we used Get-NTFSAudit which is a submodule of NTFSSecurity
for adding the audit we used Add-NTFSAudit which is a submodule of NTFSSecutiry

configuring winrm for remote windows server
For this we created 2 script:

create script: this help us to create listener and open port 5986 for http as winrm uses port 5986 to connect with windows
connect script: this help us to connect with remote windows server for this purpose we used Enter-PSSession

check audit of windows/system32 folder and windows/inf folder of remote windows server
for this, we created a script that connects to the remote windows server using the Enter-PSSession command and then checks the audit for windows/system32 and windows/inf folder also we can add audit rule to windows/system32 and windows/inf folder from remote servers
